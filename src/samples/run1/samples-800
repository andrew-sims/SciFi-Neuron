(I'll make sure he doesn't think I'm a moron, too.)




“We do not know who is behind the panels on the outside of this car.”

“No need to talk about him.”

“He’s inside.”

“I’m just staring at the door. It opens.

“You’ve known all along who’s driving the car?” I ask.

“Yes, sir—”

“He’s driving.”

“We have no idea who’s around.”

“How’s he doing?”

“Just going to his bathroom.”

“Not his. Don’t you trust me?”

“Well, in your opinion, sir, we’ve never seen him.”

“I have, sir, but sir, we’re waiting for him.”

“Oh, he’ll be there at last.”

“No one has already seen him?”

“Not yet.” The captain asks me in his pitiful voice.

Then he says: “I can’t tell you’s the exact whereabouts of
his captain. But he’ll try to get his boat inside when he’s found.”

“I’m your good man, sir, sir,” the captain exclaims.

“But no, I’m sure you can’t tell me exactly where, because you’ve
thrown your hat in the ring. We’ve been missing a couple hundred miles.”

“Is it any help in our favor to ask for a better way!”

“Just let us know.”

“The captain’s name’s Edith Cope. What’s your position here?”

“We’re looking for anyone who’s still alive who’s seen his boat, but to find out who’s on board, we want
to know who it’s driving. It’s very odd.”

“Well, if you’re looking for anyone who’s missing, it’s very hard to do unless you’ve
been through the Gulf of Mexico.”

“Yes.”

“But even if you’ve never been to the Gulf, you’ll know where he’s going
and not worry about getting on board his boat.”

“We’ll get him--he’s gone.”

“So you don’t think Edith Cope left the boat?”

“We can’t.”

“The captain’s name is Edith Cope,” I reply with a slight
disgust.

“Then we can’t give up our chances of finding him!” the captain says.

“But our men can’t give in!”

“We’re going to lose one man! You know what happened to
Cope,” I growled in anger.

“What about your men?”

“How will it compare?” The captain replies.

“Well, at least we’re in clear sight of the Gulf of Mexico.”

“No way!” I growled.

But it’s all to die for.”

“So Edith Cope drove his boat behind my back? What’s his name? What’s
his name?”

“There’s a good chance we’ll find him.”

“He’ll show up before we’re done,” I say.

“Good lord!”

In a few minutes I’m all ears on Edith Cope!”

It didn’t take long, I’m a very accomplished and determined
person who lives by the sea. So here it’s my turn.

“We’ve already started from our cabin to our right,” the captain says.

“This is our main cabin,” the captain responds.

I put on a jacket and pants,
